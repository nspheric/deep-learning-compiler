i want to see how such compiler is implemented with a dag and how to apply
some basic optimizations such as vectorization and loop unrolling.

**ill continue with this project once im done with my other ones.**

for now I can create the dag for a given vgg16 model.
    
For a better example of how all of this works check TVM and/or Hidet. Tiramisu is a good example as well.

All of these compilers target llvm and/or C.
