i want to see how such compiler is implemented with a dag and how to apply
some basic optimizations such as vectorization and loop unrolling.

i could lower this graph to llvm ir and have llvm generate the efficient
code for both gpus and cpus but want to learn simd programming and apply
my knowledge of simple optimizations such as loop unrolling which ive applied
before but i need to generate fast code.

i want to lower the whole vgg model and understand some of the basics of
deep learning.
